# Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Daniel López Moreno submission for Getting and Cleaning Data course
project.

## Dataset

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

## Files

-   codebook.rmd a code book that describes the variables, the data, and
    any transformations or work performed to clean up the data

-   run\_analysis.R performs the data preparation and then followed by
    the 5 steps required as described in the course project’s
    definition:

    -   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

    -   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard
        deviation for each measurement.

    -   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
        data set

    -   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable
        names.

    -   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
        data set with the average of each variable for each activity and
        each subject.

-   uci\_har\_dataset.txt is the exported final data after going through
    all the sequences described above.
